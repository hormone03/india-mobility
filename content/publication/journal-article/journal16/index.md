abstract: <p align="justify">It is evident that Science and Technology Studies (STS) offers important insights for energy studies research. Yet, attending to global energy problems has received less attention within this budding research engagement. Building upon John Urry’s theorization of the global, this paper calls for considering the embedding of automobility in the global South in order for the growing STS and energy studies research to take the global seriously. Empirically investigating automobility is timely and STS’ diverse tool-box of theories is uniquely positioned for the task. With the street as locus, I propose a hybrid framework that draws upon several STS literatures to conceptualize the politics of automobility in the global south. Relying on STS for this purpose offers pathways towards just low-carbon transitions.</p>

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: Vehicular congestion on the streets of Bengaluru has been tackled, since the late 1990s at least, through a hybrid coalition of actors, technologies, norms, and discourses that have political consequences.
