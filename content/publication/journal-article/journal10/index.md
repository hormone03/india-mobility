abstract: <p align="justify">Organic agriculture is often promoted as a means to achieve sustainable agriculture and livelihoods. Yet, the evidence is mixed on the outcomes of organic adoption. We conducted a case study in the South Indian state of Kerala to understand farmer motivations to adopt organic agriculture, their livelihood characteristics, and outcomes of adoption. To do so, we designed a conceptual framework bringing together key constructs from the theory of planned behaviour and the sustainable livelihoods framework. Focusing on the two districts of Thrissur and Wayanad, our work is informed by semi-structured interviews and focus groups with organic and conventional farmers and key informants. Based on this study, we developed a typology of organic farmers that we found to be analytically powerful - three core groups were identified -- wealthy “hobby farmers”; poorer “non-certified farmers”; and middle class “export farmers”. Our study revealed that these organic farmer types differ not only in their livelihood characteristics, but also in their motivations for adopting organic agriculture, as well as in their satisfaction with organic agriculture as a livelihood strategy. We found that the perceived success of organic agriculture in Kerala depends both on who adopts it and why. These differences have important policy implications. In Kerala, we suggest that policy support for organic agriculture should primarily target non-certified farmers who are poorer and ideologically committed to it, but should also address the concerns of export farmers who are more likely to persist with organic farming under favourable economic conditions. More broadly, our study shows that for states and non-profits to better support organic agriculture, nuanced understandings of the farmers involved are required.</p>

#summary: Vehicular congestion on the streets of Bengaluru has been tackled, since the late 1990s at least, through a hybrid coalition of actors, technologies, norms, and discourses that have political consequences.
