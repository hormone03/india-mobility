abstract: <p align="justify">Despite the growing economic footprint of cities, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to understanding the relation between technoscience and cities. The field of urban technoscience seeks to develop a body of knowledge to plan and design vital urban metabolic flows including water, waste, sanitation, movement, and energy. Underlying this field is the urgency to intervene in cities to solve urban problems in a scientific fashion through the development of infrastructure plans and designs. As vital sites for India’s current political economy, cities are now witness to systematic attempts to alter the technoscientific base of cities in the country. How is this shift happening in India? Drawing upon research in Science and Technology Studies (STS), history of urban planning, and allied social science fields, this paper characterizes the shift as BUS – Big Urban Science and Engineering. The paper provides an analysis of BUS and concludes with some implications of BUS for urban change in India. </p>

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: Vehicular congestion on the streets of Bengaluru has been tackled, since the late 1990s at least, through a hybrid coalition of actors, technologies, norms, and discourses that have political consequences.
