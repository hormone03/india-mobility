abstract: <p align="justify">This chapter traces how the imagination of 'roads for vehicle' has dominated the modern planning history and engineering practices in the post-independent India. This is often in contrast with the idea of 'streets for people' (as per the 2006 National Urban Transport Policy) approach to transport planning. This chapter highlights the contestations between these two imaginations through the evolution of policies, plans and projects for Indian cities. Further, the chapter captures the lived experiences of street-users and citizens in Ahmedabad. It calls for a paradigm shift from privileging and prioritizing the mobility and speed of private automobiles to the streets for all users.</p>

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: Vehicular congestion on the streets of Bengaluru has been tackled, since the late 1990s at least, through a hybrid coalition of actors, technologies, norms, and discourses that have political consequences.
