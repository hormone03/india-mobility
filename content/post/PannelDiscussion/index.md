An international panel to discuss the recent book "Installing Automobility" written by Govind Gopakumar, Chair and Associate Professor at the Centre for Engineering in Society. 

The book, a product of several years of research, makes the argument that cities around the world but particularly in India are witness to a notable transformation in the design of their streets and associated mobility patterns. These shifts are locking-in greater dependence on automobiles, which is particularly problematic for global efforts to transition to a low-carbon society. 

Interrogating this claim will be a distinguished panel composed of researchers on mobility and sustainable transition - Manisha Anantharaman, Tanu Priya Uteng, Jason Henderson, and Bipashyee Ghosh. Discussions were moderated by David Sadoway. <p align="justify">Watch the Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqOYdl5vwZw" target="_blank"> here ...</a> </p>
