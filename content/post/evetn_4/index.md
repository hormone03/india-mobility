<p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">The central objective of this research project is to critically investigate urban mobility in Indian cities in the rapidly evolving context of motorization. Several efforts ranging from infrastructural efforts such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Systems to governance and policy interventions such as urban experimentation (UE) and national urban transport policy (NUTP) have been (and are being) proposed. We seek to investigate these measures from an interdisciplinary perspective borrowing from urban geography, history of urban planning, technology policy, science and technology studies, urban design, and sustainability transitions, with an aim to assess the possibilities and potentials for equitable and just mobilities on Indian streets <a href="https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/8246449038" target="_blank">Zoom link</a>.</p> 

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">The workshop will be an opportunity to review progress in the research project. In particular, it will allow funded PhD students to present their current thinking on their research projects, and solicit comments and feedback from invited workshop mentors.</p> 

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">We are extremely happy to welcome three scholars who bring a depth of expertise in urban studies, mobilities, and transport geography.</p>

1. <p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">Dr. Sarah Moser, Associate Professor, Department of Geography, McGill University: Dr. Moser is an urban geographer whose work has critically engaged with the manifestation of power and ideology in architectures, urban plans and designs in Asian cities.</p>

2. <p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">Dr. Aryana Soliz, Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Geography, McGill University: Dr. Soliz is an urban ethnographer of mobilities whose work has examined the history and politics of velomobilities while working with cycling groups to advance just and sustainable movement in the town of Aguascalientes, Mexico.</p>

3. <p align="justify" style="font-size: 19px">Dr. Apoorva Rathod, Doctoral Graduate, University of Gothenburg, Sweden: Dr.Rathod’s work is located at the intersection of mobilities and children’s geographies.</p>
