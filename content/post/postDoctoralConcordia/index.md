<p align="justify"> The Horizon Fellows program is a key component of the Double our Research strategic direction and brings a fresh cohort of exceptional young researchers who challenge our faculty, mentor the next generation of researchers, and boost our research and creative productivity. Our Horizon Fellows work in state-of-the-art facilities and centres with top researchers, while advancing their own development as future research leaders in all sectors.

We fund 24 to 30 two-year fellowships per year in a range of disciplines where supervisors have demonstrated a link to our Strategic Research Plan. A call for applications is released based on projects selected in a highly competitive process.</p>
