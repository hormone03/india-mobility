<p align="justify">Since the early 20th century, the streets of North American cities have radically changed to accommodate cars as a primary means of transportation, a trend that has slowly spread around the world.

In his new book, Govind Gopakumar, associate professor and chair of Concordia's Centre for Engineering in Society, explores how automobility has drastically changed the make-up of India’s city streets and the social impacts caused by such a radical transformation of the urban landscape.

In Installing Automobility: Emerging Politics of Streets and Mobilities in Indian cities, published by MIT Press in their Urban and Industrial Environments Series, Gopakumar dives into the governance of car-related urban infrastructure and the redesign of streets in Indian cities.

“Unfortunately, America’s dependence on the car has spread all over the world – China now has 360 million vehicles, India has around 250 million and Brazil has over 100 million – and this is causing negative social and environmental impacts, not just immediately, but also in the long-run in shifting towards a low carbon world,” says Gopakumar.

Over the years, governments have had to drastically change transport infrastructure to accommodate an ever-increasing number of motorized vehicles, which has, Gopakumar argues, slowly altered the very essence of the city street.

“If you watch a movie portraying India around 30 to 40 years ago, city streets were filled with all kinds of vehicles and people: cyclists, pedestrians, push carts, public transit. Because motorized vehicles are everywhere now — this is also true in other parts of Asia, Africa and South America – the kinds of social interactions that used to be possible on a street have drastically changed.” <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/encs/2020/12/01/cars-made-streets-less-inclusive.html" target="_blank"> Details here ...</a> </p>
