<p align="justify">I am currently an Associate Professor and Chair of the Centre for Engineering in Society in the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science at Concordia University.</p>

 <p align="justify">I am an interdisciplinary scholar whose research interests are quite varied. Broadly, I am interested in how technological change becomes acceptable to society. In analyzing this puzzle, I think that a combination of social, policy and technical dynamics play a defining role. My specific interests are in the politics of urban infrastructure change, the persistence of unjust unsustainabilities, and globalization/development in engineering education. I am the 2010 recipient of the Robert Boguslaw Award for Technology and Humanism given by the American Sociological Association for promising young scholars. </p>

<p align="justify">I received my Ph.D. in Science and Technology Studies from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Prior to that I received a M.S. in Energy and Environmental Policy from the University of Delaware and completed my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Michigan Technological University. I have a B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from College of Engineering, University of Kerala, India.</p>
