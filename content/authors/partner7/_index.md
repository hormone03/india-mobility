<p align="justify">Jason Henderson is Professor of Geography & Environment at San Francisco State University. His research focuses on the ‘politics of mobility’ and examines how culture, history, politics, and economics shape transportation. Jason’s research and teaching are motivated by the need for rapid and accelerated decarbonization to limit global warming, and inspired by efforts to build compact, car free and cycling cities around the world. 

Jason’s most recent book was published in June 2019: Street Fights in Copenhagen: The Politics of Mobility in a Green Mobility City (co-authored with Natalie Gulsrud). This book examines the politics of the bicycle and the car in Copenhagen, Denmark, one of the world’s iconic bicycle cities.

Jason is also author of Street Fight: The Politics of Mobility in San Francisco, and co-author of Low Car (bon) Communities: Inspiring Car-Free and Car Lite Urban Futures. He has published articles in International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, Antipode, Urban Geography, the Journal of Transport Geography and several book chapters in academic books on sustainable transportation and the politics of the automobile.  

In 2018 Jason was a visiting research professor at the Institute of Geography and Center for North American Studies at Heidelberg University.  

Current research includes electric cars and the politics of “tech mobility” (driverless cars, ride hail services, and private transit).  Other research interests include green mobility (cycling, walking, public transit and compact cities), the politics of mobility and decarbonization, inspirational green mobility cities and policies around the world, energy and material resources of mobility, and in narratives about future mobility.
