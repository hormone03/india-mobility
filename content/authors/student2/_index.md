<p align="justify">Sreelakshmi is interested in understanding the institutional linkages behind various urban experimentation efforts that have sprung up of late in Indian cities. Specifically, she examines Urban Living Labs (ULLs) and the various interventions they test out in active mobility, street re-ordering and other kinds of low-carbon mobility initiatives. She seeks to investigate the role of ULLs in the longer-term urban rejuvenation project in the face of trends like embedding automobility, demographic shifts and climate change.</p>
