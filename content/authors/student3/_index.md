<p align="justify">Yogi Joseph is a PhD candidate at Concordia University, Montreal. He is deeply invested in fostering a bottom-up understanding of transport infrastructure. Deploying mobile methods such as shadowing, walk-along and ride-along interviews, he invites granular attention to the micropractices employed by mobile actors on public transport. His work examines the intersubjectivities and daily socialities formed in and around such spaces. He enjoys using audio and video recordings of everyday mobility as means of fostering a deeper understanding of movement and transport infrastructure. His recent publications investigate the steady decline of cycling and locking-in of automobility in Indian cities. Outside of work, he takes great joy in flicking the cricket ball off the hips while humming a Anu Malik-Kumar Sanu number.</p>
