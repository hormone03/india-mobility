<p align="justify">Craig Townsend currently teaches undergraduate courses in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment on urban transportation and public infrastructure finance for planners. He obtained a professional master’s of planning degree from the University of Calgary. He studied the potential for implementation of travel demand management measures in Bangkok as a graduate student, and then worked on foreign assistance in planning projects based in Thailand’s central planning agency for three years. He then researched and wrote a doctoral thesis comparing the politics and policies shaping urban transport systems in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore at Murdoch University’s Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy in Perth, Western Australia. 

He has carried out and supervised student research on Bangkok’s urban public transportation system. More recently, he has studied the form of suburbs in Canada’s large metropolitan areas and the impacts of legislated protection of non-urban land on urban growth. He is particularly interested in public transportation infrastructure and its links to the form of cities.
