<p align="justify">I teach in the School of Urban Planning and the Bieler School of Environment at McGill University. I am also a core faculty member in the inter-disciplinary inter-faculty BA&Sc programme in Sustainability, Science and Society at McGill.</p>

 <p align="justify">After having studied mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, I spent nine years in diesel engine development in the Indian truck and bus industry. I then obtained a Masterâ€™s degree in environmental science at the University of Calgary, and a PhD in environmental policy and planning at the University of British Columbia. </p>

<p align="justify">My teaching and research interests are in environmental policy and planning; urban infrastructure and services; urban transport; alternative transport fuels; and environment and development. My geographic areas of interest are the Indian sub-continent, Asia and North America. I attempt to study issues in their multiple (scientific-technological, socio-economic, political-institutional, and human behavioural) dimensions, in a manner that is policy-relevant and contextually grounded. I am interested in the following issues and approaches: policy and technology choice; science-policy interactions; the political economy of decision-making; life-cycle analysis; multi-criteria decision-making; equity impacts of policies; and institutional mechanisms for effective policy-making and implementation.
