<p align="justify">Rutul Joshi is an architect-urban planner with a Ph.D. in Transportation Studies (UWE, Bristol, UK) with 20 years of academic and research experience. Rutul chairs the Foundation module of courses for all PG programs in the Faculty of Planning. He teaches the PG Foundation Studio and subjects like history, theory, and spatial/transport planning. Rutul also heads the Doctoral programs at CEPT University.
 
Rutulâ€™s research and consultancy work focus on Transit-oriented Development (TOD), sustainable mobility, transport equity and parking policies. Rutul led a multi-year research project on contextualizing transit-oriented development for Indian cities. The key project outcome was the TOD planning handbook, which was used to train about 350 government planners and officials in the program supported by MoHUA, the Government of India. Currently, Rutul is working on issues related to parking policies in Indian cities, TOD principles to retrofit areas around transit in East African cities, and the urban mobility challenges during/after the pandemic. Apart from several academic publications, Rutul occasionally writes on civic and urban development issues in the newspapers and media.
